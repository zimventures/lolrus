# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zimventures/lolrus.git
cd lolrus

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run
lolrus
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. Launch lolrus
2. Click **New** to create a connection
3. Select a preset endpoint or enter a custom S3-compatible URL
4. Enter your access key and secret key
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify
6. Click **Save**
7. Select your connection from the dropdown
8. Select a bucket to browse

### Connection Presets

lolrus includes presets for common S3-compatible providers:

- Linode Object Storage (multiple regions)
- AWS S3 (us-east-1, us-west-2)
- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Backblaze B2
- MinIO (local development)
- Cloudflare R2

### Emptying a Bucket

The "Empty Bucket" feature is designed for situations like deprovisioning infrastructure where you need to delete all objects before the bucket can be removed.

⚠️ **Warning:** This operation is irreversible. You must type the exact bucket name to confirm.

## Building

### Local build

```bash
# Install dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build with PyInstaller
pyinstaller lolrus.spec --clean

# Output will be in dist/
```

### Cross-platform builds via GitHub Actions

Push a tag to trigger automated builds:

```bash
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

This will create builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon).

## Development

```bash
# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run linter
ruff check src/

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v

# Run the app
python -m lolrus
```

## Architecture

```
src/lolrus/
├── __init__.py       # Package metadata
├── __main__.py       # Entry point
├── app.py            # Main DearPyGui application
├── s3_client.py      # boto3 wrapper with async operations
└── connections.py    # Connection management with keyring storage
```

### Key Design Decisions

- **DearPyGui** - GPU-accelerated, pure Python GUI library with minimal dependencies
- **boto3** - AWS SDK provides excellent S3 compatibility
- **keyring** - System-native credential storage (no plaintext passwords)
- **ThreadPoolExecutor** - Background operations don't block the UI
- **PyInstaller** - Single-file executables for easy distribution
